### Running the code

1. Install node.js on the machine.
2. Install npm package http-server globally by running this command `npm install http-server -g`.
3. Open a terminal and fire this command on the root folder `npm start` or `npm run start`
4. Browse index.html on the opened port on a browser instance.
5. Angular and React applications are prebuilt and you can directly run them by loading angular.html and react.html. Index.html is also consuming react and angular outputs. 
6. If you are modifying and rebuilding the application, you need to update the file names of react in index.html as they will change with each build. 
7. Web.html file will work only when you will host react and angular applications output on 4001 and 4002 port.
